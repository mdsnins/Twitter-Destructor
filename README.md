# Twitter-Destructor
The program to delete all tweets based on user data archive.

**This repository is outdated and haven't been maintaining. Update will be available after August, 2020**

Requires: Newtonsoft's JSON library.

This program is written for console interface, but can be implemented in GUI.
I will update TwitterClient class periodically, and will be distributed in seperated repo!
